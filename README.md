# deka_coordinates
Given a city, generate the areas within this city for which to find venues. I.e. Given a rectangle, fit within it overlapping circles which cover the whole rectangle - output the coordinates of the center of the circle and their radius. Then use this to query a public API for all venues within all the circles.
